# Web Development Project 7 - Characters4Fun

Submitted by: Shrinav Loka

This web app: In this project, I created a custom web app that enables users to assemble a personalized team for any game. Key features of this project include a create form for adding new crewmates with customizable names and attributes, a summary page displaying all added crewmates, the ability to update and delete existing crewmates, and unique links for each crewmate to access their individual info pages.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total
